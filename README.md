SURVIVAL.vbe Removal
====================

This project is intended to clean SURVIVAL.vbe virus out of the USB in order to
let my teachers and classmates get rid of the terrible 360 anti-malware utility.

Use `make` in \*NIX systems to get a fresh new `.exe` if you have [WINE][1] in
your computer.

Use `mingw32-make` on Windows as long as you have [MinGW][2] properly installed.

> For convenience, the latest binary build is in the source tree.

## Instruction

1. Copy `fix_survival.exe` to the directory that is infected by `SURVIVAL.vbe`
(Usually the root directory of a USB)
2. Click the copied `fix_survival.exe` in that directory to clean the virus.
