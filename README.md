SURVIVAL.vbe cleaner
====================

This project is intended to clean SURVIVAL.vbe virus out of the USB in order to
let my teachers and classmates get rid of the terrible 360 anti-malware utility.

Use `make` in \*NIX systems to get a fresh new `.exe` if you have [WINE][1] in
your computer.

Use `mingw32-make` on Windows as long as you have [MinGW][2] properly installed.

> For convenience, the latest binary build is in the source tree.
